            <p>
                In a blender or food processor add the sliced tomatoes, the garlic cloves , the onions the basil leaves and blend until a smooth paste is formed. Add a little bit of water if needed to ease the process.<br>
                <br>
                In a pan heat the olive oil, when its hot add the paste and stir until its slightly cooked , add the stock cube or liquid stock and stir again, add the tomato sauce/ paste until you are pleased with the texture.<br>
                <br>
                Let it cook for 15 minutes and then check the salt, if you need more add a pinch of it. Add half to one teaspoon of sugar and let it cook for 5 min. Keep in mind you can add water to your taste if you want the sauce less thick. <br>
