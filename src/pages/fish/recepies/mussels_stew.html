            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 25px;">
                1 kg of Mussels <br>

                1 Large tomato well ripe <br>
                Piri-piri to taste <br>

            </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Wash the mussels and discard those that are not closed properly. <br>
                <br>
                In a large frying pan, bring the oil with the onion cut into quarters and the pepper cut into strips. <br>
                <br>
                When the onion is transparent, add the tomato cut into pieces the piri-piri, season with salt and let it fry, until the tomato undoes, add the mussels. <br>
                <br>
                Cover the pan and let them open over low heat. <br>
                <br>
                When they are cooked, sprinkle with white wine. <br>
                <br>

            <h2>Story Time</h2>
            <p>
                Another southern portuguese recepie, its recent in the family but its already a popular one. <br>
                The fresh mussels have an unique taste and you can never get enough.  <br>
                <br>
                It allways reminds me of the beaches in Algarve. <br>
