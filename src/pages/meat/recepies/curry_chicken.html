            <h2>Story Time</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that there would be no curry if the portuguese didnt discover another route to India, thanks to the new root new foods like, potatoes, tomatoes, cashews, squash, and various other fruits and vegetables were introduced . Even chili and sweet peppers, now present in Indian cuisine, weren’t available prior to The Discoveries. <br>
                <br>
                This recepie is very very simples, my mother and my godmother had different recepies for the same dish, they were both really good so i will post my recepie, a fusion from the two. Its not spicy so you can introduce this dish to kids, and let them get used to different spices. <br>
                <br>
                Usually we use coconut milk and pinaple bits but you can use apple instead, its something i tried with my cousin and its also very very good. Maybe even easier for someone picky with their food. <br>
                <br>
                You can even exclude all the fruits and still have a delicious creammy curry chicken. <br>
