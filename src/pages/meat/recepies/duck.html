            <h1>Orange Duck <span style="font-size: small;">"Pato assado dos Primos"</span> </h1> 
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 25px;">
                Duck <br>
                Soy sauce <br>
                Honey <br>
                Paprika <br>
                Scalions <br>
                Freshly squeezed orange juice <br>
                Beer <br>
                olive oil <br>
                salt <br>
                onion <br>
                garlic <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>Prepare the tofu by carefully draining the water and slice in into cubes.</p>
            <p>Prepare the duck to roast, cut any excess fat and lay it on a hoven tray.</p>
            <p>Pour a hole beer can on top of the duck, a full glass of orange juice, basicaly add everything into the duck and the tray except the honey, leave it for last.</p>
            <p>The duck will cook in the oven for a few hours, pay atencion and turn it one in a while so it doesnt burn, if the heat is too much, cover it with tinfoil.</p>
            <p>When the meat is cooked add the chiken stock ( if you only have cubes, add it to water and microwave it for a few seconds so it can dissolve ) add to tast or level of salt, add the stock and water untill the meat is covered.</p>
            <p>When you are happy and the meat is cooked turn the duck breast side up, glaze it with honey and let it crisp up. I suggest serving it with some orange slices or some of our roasted potatoes.</p>

            <h2>Story Time</h2>
            <p>This was an invented recepie back in my first University years in Algarve with my cousin, one of our English friends suggested the honey glaze to make the skin extra crispy. One of my first ever recepies.</p>
            <p>We dicovered that my mother not only loved the recepie (she is a fan of duck in general) but also with this recepie she gained the nickname of "the butcher", while we were very inexperienced in trenching birds, we cooked for her and like a ninja she butchered the turkey and left it ready to it. we were amazed by it.</p>
            <p>There are not ennough words to express how much i miss my cousin and all those happy times; the adventures in a new chapter of our lives, i learned how to be independent without ever feeling alone.</p>
