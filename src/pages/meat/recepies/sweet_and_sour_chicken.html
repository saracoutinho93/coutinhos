            <h1>Sweet and Sour Chicken <span style="font-size: small;">"酸甜鸡"</span> </h1> 
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 25px;">
                1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts<br>
                1/2 cup cornstarch <br>
                2 eggs beaten <br>
                1/4 cup flour <br>
                oil for frying <br>
                1 cup pineapple chunks <br>
                1 red bell pepper  <br>
                1 green bell pepper <br>
                1/2 onion <br>
                1/2 cup sugar <br>
                1/4 cup brown sugar <br>
                1/2 cup rice or apple cider vinegar <br>
                1/3 cup ketchup <br>
                2 teaspoons soy sauce <br>
                2 cloves garlic minced <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>
                To make the sauce, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and garlic into a small bowl. <br>
                Pour enough canola oil into a dutch oven or frying pan that is comes up from the bottom about an inch to an inch and a half.  <br> <br>
                Heat the oil on medium high to high heat, you’re looking for the chicken to cook and brown in about 2-3 minutes. <br>
                <br>
                Add the cornstarch to a large ziplock bag. <br>
                Add the chicken pieces to the large ziplock bag and shake until all the pieces are well coated. <br>
                Dip the pieces into the egg, then into the flour before adding to the hot oil. <br>
                Cook the chicken for 2-3 minutes, until cooked through and crispy. <br>
                <br>  
                Remove to a cookie sheet (no paper towels!) and continue cooking all the chicken pieces. <br>
                When done cooking remove all but a tablespoon of the oil. <br>
                Add the bell peppers, onion and pineapple and cook for 1-2 minutes, until crisp-tender. <br>
                <br>
                Add the sauce back in and stir to coat the pieces and cook for 30 seconds to help the garlic warm through. <br>
                <br>
                Add the chicken pieces back in and stir until the sauce has thickened and bubbling. <br>
                Serve immediately, with optional garnishes of sesame seeds or green onions.

            <h2>Story Time</h2>
            <p>
                This is a recepie that i've had in chinese restaurantes since i can remember. Because its sweet , kids love it. It has a lot of steps but with patience you can do it. <br> 
                <br>
                So it was a real challenge to replicate, once i tried at least 3 different recepies, this one is the closest, and its so so good. Even my grandmother loves it , she had a huge sweet tooth.  <br>
