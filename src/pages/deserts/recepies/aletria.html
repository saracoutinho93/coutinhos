            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 25px;">
                1.5 liter of water <br>
                250gr of vermicelli noodles ( aletria) <br>
                250gr of sugar <br>
                2 strips of lemon peel, only the yellow part <br>
                1 strip of orange peel <br>
                2 small cinnamon sticks <br>
                1 anise seed <br>
                2 egg yolks <br>
                powdered cinnamon to sprinkle <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Place the water in the pan and bring to a boil along with the lemon peel, cinnamon stick, anise and sugar. <br>
                <br>
                Bring to a boil, leave a little to get the flavor of cinnamon, the peels and the sugar is dissolved. <br>
                <br>
                Add the vermicelli, let it cook for about 5 minutes, I don't like it very cooked so the cooking will suit everyone's taste. <br>
                <br>
                While the vermicelli is cooking beat the egg yolks, remove some of the syrup from the mixture, mix in the egg yolks and stir well (to give a drop in temperature so that when placed directly they do not bake). <br>

            <h2>Story Time</h2>
            <p>
                This recepie was given to my by my neighbour's, i always liked her aletria. She is the mom of one my best friends so i always had some.  <br>  <br>
                Although there are many ways to cook this, with milk, with water, creammy or in cubes.  <br>  <br>
                My grandmother cooked it with milk, but this is my favourite.  <br>
