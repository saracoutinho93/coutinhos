            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 25px;">
                4 large eggs <br>
                175 g of powdered sugar <br>
                1 L of milk <br>
                1 spoon (dessert) of corn flour <br>
                1 lemon zest <br>
                Powdered cinnamon for sprinkling <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>
                In a large pan boil the milk, 125 g of powdered sugar and the lemon peel ( you can a cinammon stick if you like, let it start to boil and then reduce the heat to a minimum.<br>
                <br>
                Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks, add the remaining 50 g of sugar and beat some more. Pour spoonfuls of egg whites into the pan, a few at a time, and let them cook for about 5 minutes in the milk , turning them halfway through. Remove the farófias, drain them and place them in a bowl.<br>
                <br>
                Allow the milk to cool slightly. Mix the cornstarch with the egg yolks, add to the pan with the milk, bring to the heat and let it cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens. Drizzle the farófias with the sauce, sprinkle with cinnamon powder and serve. <br>

            <p>
                This christmas recepies is very special, although its not my particular favourite its definatly a hit with people. Very very traditional its now a kept recepie from my Grandmother, she has alzheimer's disease, she can no longer remember how to make it, but she sure loves eating it.  
                <br><br>
                It a very delicate desert, not easy to get it right. <br>
